      text: Creative curation is the art of the silver-tongue. If you can coax your
        assistant into creating stunning art, you're in business. Of course, you
        must come up with great ideas yourself, but that's what we're made for! Become
        one with your mechanical assistant and you won't see a bad day of creating
        art.
    - lineID: -1
      text: "It is important to choose your inputs with care. Mechanical assistants
        learn from observation. Feed them with boring clich\xE9s and what you'll
        get will be derivative and repugnant. Feed them with novel, pioneering, unheard
        words and you will marvel at the results."

      text: Generating high-quality imagery can be quite costly for the aspiring
        lingual artist. Be sure to be on good terms with your suppliers, as certain
        materials can be hard to find. For example, the unilateral ban on legacy
        plastic production of 2034 made acrylic paintings a rarity. These hard-to-find
        resources will make your work stand out, provided you use correct technique.

        Guided by the ideas of the late Francis Poole, these visionaries founded
        a true meritocracy. Ever since that day, humanity reaches for the stars faster
        and faster. It is all because of our city.

      text: By Francis Poole, MD, PhD

      text: Throughout my research, one question has seemed unattainable. That is
        the question of the origins creativity. Is it nature? Nurture? A combination
        of the two? Or is it blind luck that determines the creative output of a
        human being? This has been my focus and struggle in the past 40 years of
        research and experimentation.
    - lineID: -1
      text: My purpose for writing this book is to propose a theory which would answer
        this very question. My hope is that future researchers will improve and refine
        this theoretical groundwork.
    - lineID: -1
      text: Novel combinations in one's genetic constitution can thus increase their
        creativity. This finding may strike some as unsavory, reminiscent of biological
        determinism or eugenics. This is not an attempt to revive the misled practices
        of the previous century. My intent is to shed light upon a path for humanity
        to transcend its current abilities.
    - lineID: -1
      text: Recent advances in genetic editing technologies allow us to peer into
        these possibilities. It would be an undeniable gift to the world if we had
        more humans with outstanding minds. As humans will become better and better,
        who knows where we can reach! The apex of humanity is now a matter of time.

        this decades past my death, please consider: are you the best human being
        that has ever lived? If not, what is your legacy?'

      text: It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
        Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the
        vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though
        not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along
        with him.
    - lineID: -1
      text: 'The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of
        it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the
        wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face
        of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome
        features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift.'

      text: Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric
        current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive
        in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,
        who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went
        slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft,
        the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.

      text: It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow
        you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath
        it ran.
    - lineID: -1
      text: Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which
        had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from
        an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface
        of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat,
        though the words were still distinguishable.

      text: 'The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but
        there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window:
        a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by
        the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very
        fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and
        blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.'
    - lineID: -1
      text: Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down
        in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into
        spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed
        to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere.
        The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner.
    - lineID: -1
      text: There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS
        WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's
        own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully
        in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC.
        In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered
        for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight.
        It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did
        not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.

      text: Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling
        away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan.
        The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston
        made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover,
        so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque
        commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way
        of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.
    - lineID: -1
      text: "How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual
        wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all
        the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted
        to. You had to live\u2014did live, from habit that became instinct\u2014in
        the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness,
        every movement scrutinized."
    - lineID: -1
      text: "Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though,
        as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry
        of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.
        This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste\u2014this was London, chief
        city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of
        Oceania."

      text: He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether
        London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of
        rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber,
        their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron,
        their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?

      text: 'And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the
        willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the
        bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies
        of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not
        remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit
        tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.'

      text: "The Ministry of Truth\u2014Minitrue, in Newspeak \u2014was startlingly
        different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure
        of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres
        into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked
        out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:"
