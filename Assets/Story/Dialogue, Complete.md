### Scene 1

The Examiner: Hello Angela, and congratulations on reaching this stage of the competition! Please take a seat, so that we may begin Stage 3 of Capitol Creativity Cup.
	>> [1] I am ready!
		The Examiner: Very well, let us proceed. Now, at this stage of the competition I will be hearing your presentation of your idea for a novel. I assume you have already formulated one during the two previous stages, right?
		>> [2] Right! I am ready.
			The Examiner: Brilliant! Now, let me ask you first, who will the protagonist be of your novel?
				>> [4] A farmer
				>> [5] A student
				>> [6] An international spy
					The Examiner: Interesting, a [REPEAT CHOICE HERE]. What will they be trying to achieve?
						>> [7] fights evil
						>> [8] uncovers a plot
						>> [9] fights for survival
							The Examiner: Hmmm, [REPEAT CHOICE HERE]... Keep going, what is stopping them from doing that?
								[10] overcoming their fear.
								[11] going against their family.
								[12] their world being under imminent threat.
									>> The Examiner: So, they are [REPEAT CHOICE HERE], that is what is stopping them... [REPEAT FIRST CHOICE], who has to [REPEAT SECOND CHOICE], but have to deal with [REPEAT THIRD CHOICE] while at it... Hmmm, I will be honest, this sounds like the plot of [INSERT COMBINATION RESULT HERE]. Not a very original idea I would say. Perhaps you would like to rethink this?
									>> [13] Yes! Let me try this again.
										[Convo returns to [2]]
									>> [14] No, I am happy with my idea.
										>> Listen, Angela, you are a good writer and I think you've got what it takes to make it to the top, even become a Creative Pillar like your father. But at this stage, I sense you would benefit from some soulsearching and more practice because your idea of a creative work is lacking. Older works are a good source of inspiration, but using the same idea over and over again is not the way forward.
										>> For now, I am afraid you will not be passing to the next stage of the Cup. But I have every hope that when you are ready, perhaps even at next year's competition, you will do wonders with your ideas. Until then, practice your way of thinking and your writing more. [End Convo, the player leaves automatically the scene and find themselves on the Street]
		>> [3] What novel idea are you referring too?
			The Examiner: Angela, are you alright? You are participating in the Writing Pillar of the Capitol Creativity Cup, you have to present an original idea for a writing work piece, what else would I be referring too? (Reverts to previous choices, now [2] and [13] are available)
	> [13] May I have a moment please?
		The Examiner: Of course, take your time. Let me know as soon as you are ready to continue. [End Convo, the player stays in the room but if they click to leave it, they get a thought saying "I should probably finish my interview with the examiner."]

### Scene 2

Before the Sister informs Angela of the Codex Theft:

Random Citizen 1: Good day to you too! Isn't the weather beautiful this time of the year?

After the Sister informs Angela of the Codex Theft:

Random Citizen 1: What a shock! Who would steal anything from a Library??? What a harsh world we live in.

### Scene 3

Barman: If it isn't my favourite customer! What can I do for you Angela?
	> [0] It is always great seeing you Sebastian! I am afraid you can't do much for me this evening.
		Barman: I gather the competition didn't go too well? Did you pass the third stage?
			> [1] I didn't make it, but thank you for asking.
				Barman: I am really sorry Angela. Don't beat yourself up, though; there is always next time. Need something strong?
					> [3] Yes, please! 
						Barman: Haha, here you go! [Leads to 5]
					> [4] I am fine, just a tea please. 
						Barman: Ever the tranquil one; here you go! [Leads to 5]
			> [2] Just pour me a drink, will you? The regular.
				Barman: That bad, eh? Here you go! [Leads to 5]
					> [5] Thanks! Is my sister coming by the way?
						Barman: So I gather. Until she does, why don't you share with me your idea for the competition?
							> [6] Are you out of your bloody mind? It didn't go well.
								Baraman: Jeez, don't shoot! I am asking only to help you.
									> [8] I do not need any help. I just need to brew in my own stew for a while.
										Barman: Fair enough. I am here if you need someone to talk to. [CONVO END. If the Player re-clicks on the Barman, then they get a "Better now?" response and number 7 is available as a choice.]
							> [7] Sure. So, my idea for the competition was [REPEAT FINAL CONVO CHOICES FROM SCENE 1]. What do you make of it?
								Barman: Hmmmm, not bad kiddo, but it does remind me a bit of [REPEAT COMBINATION RESULT HERE]. Would be a bit cliche to follow that path, don't you think?
									> [9] Ahhh, that is what the examiner said as well. Nothing gets past you, doesn't it?
										Barman: Hahaha, I used to be a Digital Crime Investigator, remember? I must say though... !! [Convo continues on [11]]
									> [10] Is it though? Is it really that cliche?
										Barman: Put it this way: if I was still on the force we might have arrested you for excessive clicheness. I must say though... !! [Convo continues on [11]]
										>> [11] Is everything alright Sebastian?
											Barman: Your sister	just entered the bar and she seems upset. Maybe you should talk to her? [Convo Ends]
	>> [X] May I get some hot tea for the road please?
		Barman: Sure thing Angela, coming right up! [CONVO ENDS. Player gets a tea thermos for their inventory. If they re-click this, they same answer appears, but no new items are added to the inventory.]

Sister: Angela! Sorry for being late.
	> [1] Is everything alright Sophie?
		Sister: I am afraid not. I was just on the phone with father and he is really upset. A rare codex was stolen from the Library and he was in charge of its official processing.
			>> [3] A rare codex? Was it that valuable to truly upset father?
				Sister: Apparently yes. Father mentioned that it might contain literary ideas lost in time. To whomever decyphers it first, these ideas could be worth a lot, depending on how they use them.
					> [5] New literary ideas... they could make or break one's career I suppose.
						Sister: I suppose so. This is government property, though, Angela. Don't get any ideas.
							> [6] I should visit the Library, learn more.
								Sister: Tread lightly Angela, you shouldn't meddle in their affairs. But I guess it wouldn't hurt learning more about this.
							> [7] You are right, I am only joking.
								Sister: Are you now? In any case, the Library is the center of investigations. Only the librarians there know more now.
			> [4] Father is overreacting again, as always.
				Sister: That is not a nice thing to say Angela. Anyway, this is a big deal; the Library is under investigation by the police and the librarians there are very upset as well. They have locked down parts of it to aid the police in their process of uncovering who did this.
	> [2] At least you made it! 
		Sister: I promised I would be here when you were done with the competition, didn't I?
		> [8] Did you bring what I requested?
			Sister: Of course! Here you go. [CONVO ENDS. Player gets a notebook in their inventory.]
	>> [Upon exhausting the first dialogue]: I will do some more investigation on the codex!
		Sister: Make sure you let me know what you find out!

### Scene 4

The Librarian: Oh Angela, so good to see you here! I am afraid this is not the best of times to visit the Library as we have had a major incident! A theft has occured in our Vault! I hope the police will be able to sort it out. In the meantime, how may I help you?
	> Do not worry Dr [INSERT NAME HERE], I am sure whatever has happened here, this Library still remains a wonderful place to visit!
		The Librarian: Ah, I see you are a woman of culture as well! *Chuckles* As you already know, this Library is the foremost repository of knowledge in the Capitol, founded the same year as the city by its first Governor. I hope this incident does not diminish our citizens' trust in our work and capability to protect them while they spend their time here.
			> Interesting that bit about the founding of the Library. Please tell me more.
			The Librarian: It was founded as a place were the fruits of our collective Creativity could be stored, catalogued and studied for generations to come. Today, we librarians serve that purpose with the utmost integrity; and in the process, we welcome the public on a daily basis.
				> I have heard that this place is fully automated as well! Is that true?
					The Librarian: Ahem, not everything can be run on autopilot I am afraid, and certainly not creativity! We librarians listen to the public and help them locate the most efficient and creative book for their purpose among the millions of volumes stored here.
						>> Automation must surely have helped with even the more creative pursuits.
							The Librarian: Well, yes, I suppose. That was certainly the thesis of one of my books on curating creativity; I do seem to remember works of art being made that way, to prove whether automation could replace human creativity. With limited results, of course. Creativity is not something a machine could best a human at, my dear fellow.
			> Is everything really catalogued here? Can I find everything?
				The Librarian: Well... everything published of course, we cannot store work we don't know off. But if it has been published, if the public eye has seen it, then yes, I am proud to say you will find it here. Of course, not everything is available to the public, a lot of books and pieces of work are under restoration in the Vault, while other pieces are in such a state that even touching them may irrevocably damage them. Those are out of bounds to everyone but the librarians themselves I am afraid.
					>> What if I need to access the Vault?
						The Librarian: I am afraid you will need special permission for that and only for important reasons. The Vault is not a playground for everyone to access at will.
						>> I do have special permission! (Lie)
							The Librarian: Hahaha, nice one! No-one is registered today with a special permission due to the theft. Better stop lying and explore the library on your own.
						>> How do I get special permission?
							The Librarian: I am afraid no-one will be issued a special permission for a while now; the police have locked the Vault down until the forensic analysis is done. I would suggest you postpone your visit to it and just enjoy the upper part of the Library for now.
	>> Is it alright if I still search for a book? I am in need of one.
		The Librarian: Of course! Which book will that be?
			>> I need to learn more on the Creative Process; anything on that?
				The Librarian: Certainly! We do have a lot of books on the Creative Process in Section A. Why don't you take a look for yourself?
			>> I have heard rumours of ideas being exhanged in the black market. Anything on that?
				The Librarian: A most inappropriate behaviour by our citizens! But of course, we do have books that examine illegal activities in our country and efforts made by our brave officers to quell them. Do try Section X.
	>> I did hear about the theft, but I thought security was tight around here; how did this happen?
		The Librarian: That is what we thought as well, but apparently some of the alarms didn't go off. The police has yet to determine how the thief entered the Library. It does seem unnatural that they got through any of windows though; despite the alarms, the Library is in a very public spot within the city and we have no witnesses seeing anyone entering or exiting the building during the supposed time of the theft. We will learn more once the forensic report is out though. Until then, the only thing we know is that a rare codex was stolen from the Vault.
			>> What was in the codex?
				The Librarian: This was a rare codex we just discovered in an archeological excavation. It is our understanding that it may contain literary ideas from a past civilization yet unheard of to us. I suppose that is what made it valueable enough to be stolen in the first place.

Keypad: Capitol Inner Vault, Authorised Personnel Only. Enter 4-Digit Password:
	>> Wait.. I don't know the password! What was I thinking?
		[Upon clicking that, the dialogue ends and the box disappears.]
	>> Let's try something random!
		Keypad: Access Denied.
		>> Hmmm, maybe a second try..
			Keypad: Access Denied.
			>> Third time is the charm!
				Keypad: ACCESS DENIED. D-E-N-I-E-D. [the letters appear one by one for the final word. The loop returns to being able to select the first choice again.]
	[After the player reads the excerpt from 'From the Foundation of the Capitol']
	>> Hmmm, let's try the date of the Capitol's Founding, 2042.
		Keypad: Access Granted. Door Unlocked. [the animation shows a door unlocking.]

### Scene 5

[Thief needs the thermos to talk]
[Angela needs her notebook to get the thief's testimony]

Before Angela gives the thief the thermos:
	Thief: ... thirsty ....
		Angela: If only I could give her water or something.

After Angela gives the thermo to the thief:
	Thief: Thank you for that... I have been trapped here for some hours now.
		> [1] Who are you?
			Thief: I was coming back here to pick up something I forgot. Now that I am feeling better, I will be on my way.
				> [3] This Vault was supposed to be sealed. How did you access it?
					Thief: I got in before they sealed it away, but they seem to have forgotten I was here and must have sealed it away with me inside.
				> [4] You forgot something? Do you work here?
					Thief: Sort of... I was tasked to collect something. But now I will be on my way if you don't mind.
						> [5] Collect something...? Wait! You must be the thief everyone is talking about!
							Thief: Please, I can explain!
								> [6] Is there anything to explain? I caught you red-handed!
									Thief: Yes, I came here initially to steal a codex... but I am not to blame! This is the only thing I can do, they have given me no choice!
										> [8] That's what all criminals say!
											Thief: That is not true! You would say the same if it meant you could enjoy the fresh air for once. [Convo Ends for now, the Thief tells her story in [10]]
										> [9] Explain yourself.
											Thief: This story may take a moment or two. Here it is. [Convo Ends for now, the Thief tells her story in [10]]
								> [7] There is nothing to explain! I am calling for help!
									Thief: Please! Just give me a chance! [Convo allows for [6] now only]
		> [2] How did you end up trapped here?
			Thief: I think they must have not noticed me being here when they sealed the Vault. A few moments later I realised it, panicked and must have fainted as a result.

The Thief's Story [10]: 
	I do not leave very far from here; you see, all major government buildings are connected in this city with my birthplace. I came from a place we call the Underground, a small community of people living beneath this city. My people are tasked with writing mostly, producing fresh ideas for novels, films, radio, you name it. We enjoy a relative peace but this doesn't mean we are free as well; we are forced to do this on behalf of the authorities of the outside world. We submit our ideas to them and they use them in whatever way they see fit. In exchange, we get food, clothing, anything we need really. They provided us with all the resources we need; just not our freedom. If someone really wants to leave... well you have to bribe the guards, and this takes money. I really want to leave that place... to live in the sun, among you. So, yes, I steal whatever people upstairs believe is valuable. And I am now very close to gaining the necessary amount of money to finally escape this hell hole. Unfortunately I am the only one who sees this inside my family... they are content with their life and work, they do not want to risk it. But I do! How can anyone live in a cage like that? Please... show some compassion and let me go.
		> [11] Underground what society now??
			Thief: It is true! I did sense that this must be a general secret upstairs as well... but why would they share it? This is how they get all their ideas! You think your leaders are capable of always being creative?
				>> [15] You are seriously telling me that our Societal Pillars are just a bunch of stealing thieves?
					Thief: I am! It is true! Just ask them if you dare... go catch one and ask them!
		>> [12] I am really sorry to hear that. Maybe I could do something about it? Help in any way?
			Thief: It would be really helpful if you could note what I said and use it in anyway possible to stop this madness.
				> [13, if the player has the notebook]: Sure, let me do that! [CONVO ENDS, the player gains a document icon in the inventory called the Thief's Testimony]
				> [14, if the player doesn't have the notebook]: Let me get something to write it down; I will be back! [Until you get the notebook, when the player talks to the thief, number [12] will be active as a dialogue option]

### Scene 6

This scene features no dialogue, only bubble thoughts and item descriptions.

The player needs to google things here, so when they exit the Vault they will get a thought bubble saying "I better check online for more information on the things I found in the Vault".

### Scene 7

[Unlock Father confession: first thief’s testimony, then security report, then elevator key]

Father: Hello, darling. It is good of you to stop by. How are you?
	> [1] I just heard about the codex, is everything alright?
		Father: I wish I could say that it was. Unfortunately, the stealing of the codex is a serious breach in our security, and a personal embarashment to me personally.
			> [2] Embarashment? Why?
				Father: I am the head of research on this project and the codex appeared to be extremely valuable; exactly because of its value, I was also co-ordinating with the Security Department of our Police Force on this. As one of Governors of this great city, this could potentially tarnish my good name if the codex is not found soon.
					>> [3] Is there anything I can do to help?
						Father: My dear Angela... I wish there was. Although, if you really want to help maybe you could visit the Library and check the situation for yourself? I doubt it will be that easy to retrieve the codex, but maybe you could report back to me on the situation there?
							> [4] I will do that! You can count on me! [CONVO ENDS]
	> [5] [Appears after the conversation with the thief/makes [3] disappear as an option] I am coming from the library, Father, and I have troubling news. I may have just discovered that there is an entire cast of people living underground this very city.
		Father: Hmmm that sounds serious. Are you sure? An entire community leaving underground?
		>> Yes! And I have good knowledge on this.
			Father: You do? Let me see. [CONVO ENDS. Angela has to present the thief’s testimony to unlock next step.]
				Father: (Reads testimony) This is certainly a serious accusation Angela. But you have to agree that the story of a thief you got does not make this necessarily real.
					> [6] I have more!
						Father: You do? Let me see. [CONVO ENDS. Angela has to present the security report to unlock next step.]
							Father: (Reads the report) This report certainly makes your case more real. But I am skeptical about this. A report like this could have been forged, it has happened before. You would need something more substantive if you were to prove such a theory.
								> [7] I have an item that does bind this together.
									Father: An item you say? Let me see then. [CONVO ENDS. Angela has to present the pass key to unlock next step.]
										Father: ... Where did you find this?
											> [8] Does it matter?
												Father: I suppose it doesn't. [Convo leads to [10]]
											> [9] In the Vault, it must have fallen from the thief.
												Father: So that was how was using the elavator... [Convo leads to [10]]
		>> On second thought, maybe?
			Father: I am here if you want to talk more, honey. Just come to me when you are ready [End Convo]

The Father's Confession [10]:
	So, you really did discover the truth behind the Underground. It is true, all of it. The Founders of the Capitol did set up an underground society to produce - or rather, to mine - ideas that they then could feed to the people that became the Societal Pillars. Unfortunately, a society of pure originality was not possible back then; was never possible. A person cannot have an unlimited amount of original ideas without resorting to cliches at any point in their lives! But we really wanted to prove to our selves that we could be original, that cliches in works of fiction were avoidable. So we set up the Underground and we connected it to our world through the Capitol Mainframe. We, the Board of Governors, are the inheritors of the Founders's will. We maintain this system through the mainframe, we feed the ideas to the right people and we secure order in an ever more creative world. Every book, every post, every film is new; people never run out of content, never get bored! We trully have achieved a Golden Age of Media! In this spirit, I hope you will help me keep this secret.
		> [11] Father, this seems like a huge mistake; can the world run like this forever?
			Father: Of course; as long as we stick to the system. And now, with your help, we can continue doing so.
				> [12] What do you mean?
					Father: Perhaps learning of this on your own proves that you are really worthy of being one of us. What do yous say? Join us, the Board of Governors, and help us - help me - keep this secret. In exchange, you will become a Societal Pillar, just as you always dreamt of. Status, fame, ideas, whatever you seek can be yours.
						>> [13] I need a moment to think.
							Father: Take your time. Get closer to the mainframe, take a look of society from above. This could help you, perhaps, to make up your mind. [CONVO ENDS. The player can now interact with the mainframe for the final choice.]

The Computer:
	[Before reaching 13]: Capitol Central Mainframe. Access Denied.
	[After reaching 13]: Capitol Central Mainframe. Access Granted.
		Angela thinking: So this is what it feels like to watch the world from above: watching over everyone, setting government and civilian forces in motion through the press of a button. But also, turning them off as well. It is tempting... What should I do?
			> [Final 1]: Join my father and the Board; together, we could continue fighting for Creativity and maybe eventually find a solution.
			> [Final 2]: This is wrong, I am turning this system off.
			> [Final 3]: Perhaps there is a third solution?

Final 1:
	Angela: I have made my decision; I will be joining you, Father.
	Father: I am really glad to hear that, Angela. I think this will be for the best. You are about to become part of something bigger than all of us. Welcome, my child, to the Board.

Final 2:
	Angela: This is wrong! I am putting an end to this! [*Types Quickly*]
	Computer: Termination sequence initiated. Preparing to delete all data. Initiating Underground release sequence.
	Father: Noooooo! What have you done? This will plunge society into Anarchy!!
	Angela: It had to be done, Father. I hope you come to see this as beneficial to society, which it will be in the long term.

Final 3:
	An Inner Voice: You could always disconnect from the Internet. And face reality for what it is.


Ending 1:
	Black Screen, White Letters in the middle:
	And so Angela decided to join the Board of Governors and keep the secret she was entrusted by her Father. In the years ahead Society continued to function as always. Its citizens enjoyed the same prosperity they always did, and none was the wiser. And they lived happilly ever after. 

	The End

Ending 2:
	Black Screen, White Letters in the middle:
	In the years that followed, society faced great turmoil. Re-balancing the system was no easy task; people had to learn to live differently, to accept that originality was not a God, to depend on their own mind and not on the work of others. But eventually they made peace with themselves and a new dawn came for civilization, one that looked better and brighter than before.

	The End

Ending 3:
	Blue Screen, White Letters in the middle:
	Internet Disconnected...
	... perhaps for the best. Sometimes it is best to reconnect with the world outside.
	Go out and enjoy.

	And thank you.
