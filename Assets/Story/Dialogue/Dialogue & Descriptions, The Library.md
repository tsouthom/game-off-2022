The Origin
Dialogue, The Library

## Story Overline
* The player arrives at the library to try and get some inspiration to use on the next Foundation for Human Progress, having lost the previous one (in the game intro).
* It is possible that the player has learnt of the MacGuffin by this stage already.
* When she learns about the Vault, she thinks that if she can sneak in she may find something interesting.

## Game Mechanics
* Dialogue that appears with two >> means the player can press the option again and get the dialogue again as many times as they want.
* Dialogue with only one > means the player may get the dialogue only once; after that, the option disappears.
* Item descriptions and thought bubbles appear as text over the cursor when the cursor is hovering over them. When the cursor moves, the text disappears.

### Dialogue, The Librarian
The Librarian: Welcome to the Capitol's Library! My name is Dr [Green Book author name] and I am the Head Librarian here. How may I help you?

> What a wonderful place, this Library!
	The Librarian: Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well! *Chuckles* This Library is the foremost repository of knowledge in the Capitol, founded the same year as the city by its first Governor. It was founded as a place were the fruits of our collective Creativity could be stored, catalogued and studied for generations to come. Today, we librarians serve that purpose with the utmost integrity; and in the process, we welcome the public on a daily basis.
	> Is everything really catalogued here? Can I find everything?
		The Librarian: Well... everything published of course, we cannot store work we don't know off. But if it has been published, if the public eye has seen it, then yes, I am proud to say you will find it here. Of course, not everything is available to the public, a lot of books and pieces of work are under restoration in the Vault, while other pieces are in such a state that even touching them may irrevocably damage them. Those are out of bounds to everyone but the librarians themselves I am afraid.
		>> What if I need to access the Vault?
			The Librarian: I am afraid you will need special permission for that and only for important reasons. The Vault is not a playground for everyone to access at will.
			>> I do have special permission! (Lie)
				The Librarian: Hahaha, nice one! No-one is registered today with a special permission. Better stop lying and explore the library on your own.
			>> How do I get special permission?
				The Librarian: Special permissions are granted at the Capitol Town Hall; you better talk to one of the Citizen Support Officers there if you feel you need one.

>> I am in need of a book
	The Librarian: Of course! Which book will that be?
		>> I need to learn more on the Creative Process; anything on that?
			The Librarian: Certainly! We do have a lot of books on the Creative Process in Section A. Why don't you take a look for yourself?
		>> I have heard rumours of ideas being exhanged in the black market. Anything on that?
			The Librarian: A most inappropriate behaviour by our citizens! But of course, we do have books that examine illegal activities in our country and efforts made by our brave officers to quell them. Do try Section X.

> Head Librarian? I thought this place run on autopilot.
	The Librarian: Ahem, not everything can be run on autopilot I am afraid, and certainly not creativity! We librarians listen to the public and help them locate the most efficient and creative book for their purpose among the millions of volumes stored here.
	>> Automation must surely have helped with even more creative pursuits.
		The Librarian: Well, yes, I suppose. That was certainly the thesis of one of my books on curating creativity; I do seem to remember works of art being made that way, to prove whether automation could replace human creativity. With limited results, of course. Creativity is not something a machine could best a human at, my dear fellow.

### Dialogue, Keypad
Keypad: Capitol Inner Vault, Authorised Personnel Only. Enter 4-Digit Password:
>> Wait.. I don't know the password! What was I thinking?
	[Upon clicking that, the dialogue ends and the box disappears.]

>> Let's try something random!
	Keypad: Access Denied.
	>> Hmmm, maybe a second try..
		Keypad: Access Denied.
		>> Third time is the charm!
			Keypad: ACCESS DENIED. D-E-N-I-E-D. [the letters appear one by one for the final word. The loop returns to being able to select the first choice again.]

[After the player reads the excerpt from 'From the Foundation of the Capitol']
>> Hmmm, let's try the date of the Capitol's Founding, 2042.
	Keypad: Access Granted. Door Unlocked. [the animation shows a door unlocking.]

### Item Descriptions

Hovering over any of the three pickable books:
	Hmmm, that seems interesting... [BOOK TITLE HERE], let's take a look.

Hovering over the Librarian:
	First time: She must be working here, let's ask for some help.
	Any other time: Dr [HER NAME], Head Librarian

Hovering over the Keypad:
	The Keypad to the Inner Vault

Hovering over the Vault Door
	Before unlocking: The door to the Inner Vault. It appears to be locked.
	After unlocking: This way to the Inner Vault.


### Thought-Bubble

Hovering over a desk:
	A 'Calligraphy 3000' stainless desk, sweet!

Hovering over random book cases:
	Books, books, books, no end to them.

Hovering over one of the book cases near the beginning of the scene:
	Section A: Creativity. It is the binding force of our world, I suppose.

Hovering over one of the book cases in the middle of the scene:
	Section D: History. We usually shun old ideas, but sometimes they make the best foundation for original ones.

Hovering over one of the book cases towards the end of the scene:
	Section X: Criminology. Sounds interesting; I wish I had time to read more on this.

Hovering over some parts of the windows:
	It is pretty shady in here; what are they afraid, the sun would get in and show us the truth?
