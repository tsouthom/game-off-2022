Exiting the Vault:
	I better check online for more information on the things I found in the Vault.
Googling the pass-key:
	A standard-issue XKS Elevator Key. They used these for large elevators, usually in mining operations where they had to load and unload cargo from levels deep within the ground. This key features the Coat of Arms of the Capitol, so it must belong to a large underground elevator used by the government. But where? The Capitol seized its mining operations almost 40 years ago, now everything runs on nuclear fusion reactors.
Googling the security report:
	A report that appears to have been authored by the Capitol Police, Security Department. It bears the signature of the Head of Security for the Capitol and is dated and structured according to official protocol. Appears genuine.
Hovering over the security report:
	Underground Security Report 15 May 2056: Population under control, no major issues. Elevator key-pad appears tampered with, has logged uses unaccounted for by officials, operated with standard issued key. Looking into that.

### Scene 7:

Hovering over the Father:
	My Father
Hovering over the Mainframe:
	The Capitol Central Mainframe. This is the one computer to rule them all; everything in the city passes through this monitor.
