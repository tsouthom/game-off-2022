# The Origin: Game Story, Initial Draft

## Quick Notes
- The protagonist's name is Angela, she is 23 years old and an aspiring writer. She has participated in many short stories competitions in school and have won praise as an up-and-coming Creativity beacon.
- The thief will not have a connection with the protagonist's mother. In fact, I have taken the mother out as to not add any more characters yet.

## The Story

#### Scene 1 [Competition Grounds]:
Angela is participating in a writing competition. During one of the competition stages, she has to present an original idea. The interviewer asks her about her idea, only for Angela to answer disappointgly (Convo). The interviewer will turn her down but will be encouraging; she will encourage Angela to go out there and seek her own ideas, be innovative, creative. 
Angela will leave the competition disappointed but with a fire burning within her - she knows she can do this and she will find her unique idea!

#### Scene 2 [Street]:
Angela walks down the street and decides to take a break for the day and hit a nearby bar.
* The street will serve as the main connecting avenue between scenes; all building visited will be accessed through the street scene.

#### Scene 3 [Bar]:
Angela gets into the bar. She is a regular there and she greets the barman, and proceeds to tell him about her day. She tests a few ideas with him (Convo) and he makes fun of all three (in a familiar, encouraging way, he is her friend). The barman reminds her that he used to be a Digital Crime Investigator for the City Police (later clue) before dropping everything for a less stressful life as a barman, and that nothing gets past him, certainly not a bad plot. They laugh and he proceeds to fix her a drink. 
At that moment, after he has left to prepare the drink, Angela is joined at the bar by her sister. She learns that her father, one of the City's Board of Governors, has just been notified of an incredibly important theft of a valuable codex from the City Library.
Angela is curious and does get a few pieces of information from her sister: rumour has it, there is a solid ready-to-publish idea in that codex and that is why it is so valuable to end up in the underground ghost writing market; now, a lot of people are rushing to put their hands on it. 
Angela ponders if they could get it back and use it herself, to which leading her sister to reprimand her: using the codex in such a way would not be moral. Each one must be responsible for their own ideas.
* The player has to actually click on her sister's icon or she may also leave the bar without talking to her; if she does leave, she can explore the world a bit but no new areas are unlocked yet.
* There can be other random people at the bar who could provide feeler convo.

#### Scene 4 [Library]:
Angela is frustrated; the codex idea would be perfect for her, but she has neither the means to access the underground network herself, nor any other information on it to seek it out. Seeking to do some exploring on her own, she decides to visit the library and do some research.
After talking with the librarian, she realises that there is an Inner Vault at the premises holding sensitive titles, which was the holding place of the codex. That sounds like the perfect place to start her investigation. However, the librarian denies her access, telling her that the vault is currently off limits to anyone but the authorities. 
Walking around the library a bit, Angela reads an excerpt from a book on the founding of the Capitol and realises that the founding year of the city may also be the Vault's password (remembering her father telling her that usually government passwords are linked to their history that way). She tries the password and enters the Vault.
* [Side Story: Angela may find the Creative Curations book and present it to the librarian which unlocks the Six Portraits side quest; if Angela gathers all portraits, she presents them to the librarian and gets a commendation]

#### Scene 5 [Vault]:
In the Vault, Angela stumbles upon a mysterious figure whom she startles.
The thief is startled but they engage in conversation, with Angela demanding the codex back. Through convo, the thief reveals that she is part of an underground society dedicated to producing ideas for a living which go directly to the government; she is frustrated by this way of life and so she has taken up selling the ideas in order to gain enough money to buy her way out and into society proper. 
She explains what is going on with the underground society and its twisted existance: while people live relatively normal lives underground, they do not enjoy the benefits and the luxury of the overground world. However, she is not able to answer how this actually benefits the world above. 
She also reveals that she got into the Vault to get the codex but then returned to cover her tracks, and in the process she saw the report on the underground security status; figuring out this was about her, she tried to steal it, only to be foiled by the player.
Armed with this knowledge, Angela decides to confront her father, so she heads back to the Government's Office.
Upon close examination of the area, Angela also discovers a pass-key. She has no idea where this fits, but takes it anyway, with a thought of doing more research. She also gets (if the player finds it and takes it) a rare manuscript and an assistant librarian's keycard.
* [Angela has a choice: turn the thief in to the police or retrieve the codex for herself. This does not affect the endings - those will be affected by the player's final choice - but does affect the badge the player gains at the end, or perhaps the post-ending, what happened after the player's final choice and corresponding ending.]

#### Scene 6 [Library]:
Back at the Library (upstairs), Angela googles the image of the pass-key (dragging and dropping the key in a computer). She finds out that it is a standard-issue Government Pass-key used used at the Government House. It also appears deactivated. Doing more digging, the key activates and a digital notebook on an "underground activities progress report" appears. It seems that an underground project is going well, but seems to be suffering from a security issue, a leak; the author is calling upon the recipient of the report to tighten security.
Angela combines the new report with the thief's testimony to get the revelation that this could be a darker government secret. She decides to go and talk to her father about it.
* [If Angela googles the rare manuscript she learns that is rare, which she knew, and a random latin quote - every time she googles the manuscript she will get a different quote from a wide array of quotes on creativity, leadership and innovation; a little easter egg]
* [Angela can google all inventory items; if we do not specify anything new, she will just get their normal descriptions]

#### Scene 7 [Governor's Office, Government House]
Angela is shown in to the Governor's Office on the last floor of the Government House, where she meets her father. She confronts him about the underground society and he reveals the truth: that this is a system set in parallel to uphold the illusion of internal Creativity. 
The people in the underground society live in bliss; they are paid well and they live without knowledge of the outside world, happy in their work. At the same time, the overground society prospers. The central computer behind him upholds the entire system; it processes the ideas from bellow, it distributes them to the pillars of society (people like him), it keeps security running and it monitors society for cliches which then it uproots (indirectly, through contacting the police force or publishers).
The player has the following options:
1. They can turn the computer off; basically they throw something at it to destroy it; this leads to the "rebellion" ending, anarchy ensues and a new dawn for humanity arises.
2. They can agree with their father and join forces; this leads to the "becoming a pillar ending"; the player joins her father in the system, with ideas being rooted towards her as well for her own use; Angela prospers and the truth goes unnoticed.
3. The player can turn off their internet; nothing is destroyed, but we make a profound statement about escaping [HURRAY!!].

The player gets one of three endings, along with a badge (one for reporting the thief or one for keeping quiet) and a commendation for restoring all paintings to the library. They could get other badges too, like a badge for finishing the Office Puzzle under X amount of seconds, we will see.

We thank everyone for playing and wish them well.

And then we have chicken wings. At least I will, you can join me or not, it is up to you.

The End

OR NOT? I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet what happens after this. Maybe I will live happily ever after and Elon will lead Twitter to bankruptcy. I mean, it is a Brave New World out there, we'll see.
