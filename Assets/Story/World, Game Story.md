# The Origin: Game Story, Initial Draft

## Quick Notes
- The protagonist's name is Angela, she is 23 years old and an aspiring writer. She has participated in many short stories competitions in school and have won praise as an up-and-coming Creativity beacon.
- The thief will not have a connection with the protagonist's mother. In fact, I have taken the mother out as to not add any more characters yet.

## The Story

#### Scene 1 [Competition Grounds]:
Angela is participating in a writing competition. During one of the competition stages, she has to present an original idea. The interviewer asks her about her idea, only for Angela to answer disappointgly (Convo). The interviewer will turn her down but will be encouraging; she will encourage Angela to go out there and seek her own ideas, be innovative, creative. 
Angela will leave the competition disappointed but with a fire burning within her - she knows she can do this and she will find her unique idea!

#### Scene 2 [Street]:
Angela walks down the street and decides to take a break for the day and hit a nearby bar.
* The street will serve as the main connecting avenue between scenes; all building visited will be accessed through the street scene.

#### Scene 3 [Bar]:
Angela gets into the bar. She is a regular there and she greets the barman, and proceeds to tell him about her day. She tests a few ideas with him (Convo) and he makes fun of all three (in a familiar, encouraging way, he is her friend). The barman reminds her that he used to be a Digital Crime Investigator for the City Police (later clue) before dropping everything for a less stressful life as a barman, and that nothing gets past him, certainly not a bad plot. They laugh and he proceeds to fix her a drink. 
At that moment, after he has left to prepare the drink, Angela is joined at the bar by her sister. She learns that her father, one of the City's Board of Governors, has just been notified of an incredibly important theft of a valuable codex from the City Library.
Angela is curious and does get a few pieces of information from her sister: rumour has it, there is a solid ready-to-publish idea in that codex and that is why it is so valuable to end up in the underground ghost writing market; now, a lot of people are rushing to put their hands on it. 
Angela ponders if they could get it back and use it herself, to which leading her sister to reprimand her: using the codex in such a way would not be moral. Each one must be responsible for their own ideas.
* The player has to actually click on her sister's icon or she may also leave the bar without talking to her; if she does leave, she can explore the world a bit but no new areas are unlocked yet.
* There can be other random people at the bar who could provide feeler convo.

#### Scene 4 [Library]:
Angela is frustrated; the codex idea would be perfect for her, but she has neither the means to access the underground network herself, nor any other information on it to seek it out. Seeking to do some exploring on her own, she decides to visit the library and do some research.
After talking with the librarian, she realises that there is an Inner Vault at the premises holding sensitive titles, which was the holding place of the codex. That sounds like the perfect place to start her investigation. However, the librarian denies her access, telling her that the vault is currently off limits to anyone but the authorities. 
Walking around the library a bit, Angela reads an excerpt from a book on the founding of the Capitol and realises that the founding year of the city may also be the Vault's password (remembering her father telling her that usually government passwords are linked to their history that way). She tries the password and enters the Vault.
* [Side Story: Angela may find the Creative Curations book and present it to the librarian which unlocks the Six Portraits side quest; if Angela gathers all portraits, she presents them to the librarian and gets a commendation]

#### Scene 5 [Vault]:
In the Vault, Angela stumbles upon a mysterious figure whom she startles. The mysterious figure flees without talking, but upon close examination Angela discovers a pass-key. She has no idea where this fits. She does a little more digging and finds a notebook on 'underground activities progress'. It seems that an underground project is going well in general, but seems to be having a leak; the author calling upon the recipient to tighten security.
Angela takes the notebook with her. She also gets (if the player finds it and takes it) a rare manuscript and an assistant librarian's keycard.

#### Scene 6 [Library]:
Back at the Library (upstairs), Angela googles the image of the passkey (dragging and dropping the key in a computer). She finds out that it is a standard-issue Government Passkey used at the Government House. It also appears deactivated.
* [If Angela googles the rare manuscript she learns that is rare, which she knew, and a random latin quote - every time she googles the manuscript she will get a different quote from a wide array of quotes on creativity, leadership and innovation; a little easter egg]
* [Angela can google all inventory items; if we do not specify anything new, she will just get their normal descriptions]
Angela ponders that she must know someone with a government affiliation that could help her off the books [clue: the barman].

#### Scene 7 [Bar]:
Angela realises that the barman can help her and heads over to the bar.
The barman is relactant at first; Angela has to persuade him a little bit through dialogue. She explains that she is after this mysterious underground idea and that this could be the key to it.
The barman reveals that he can help and that he is indeed part of the 'underground game', but wants something in return; he is in the business of trading valuable works of art and writing and if Angela can procure one for him, he will help her out. 
* [Angela needs the rare manuscript to proceed]
Angela gives the barman the rare Roman manuscript and he proceeds to re-activate the key. He also explains that this is not an ordinary key; Government keys have patterns that reflect the area they are used and this one seems like an Official's Lounge Key. The barman also adds that he feels this is weird, since the Official's Lounge at Government House is never locked (it is more of a common area) and while coming and going, he never saw a lock there.
Angela also questions the barman on the underground game. He proceeds to explain that there is an underground network of sellers and buyers for creative ideas and works; for the right price, you can buy from an initial but innovative writing idea all the way to a completed novel you can publish in your name. Angela is appalled, but at the same time intrigued; this could save her career after all.

#### Scene 8 [Government House]:
Angela visits Government House; making an excuse of visiting her father, she is told to wait for him at the Official's Lounge. While there, Angela solves a small puzzle (gethering some pieces that connect together and fit on a wall block) that opens a key card hole. 
* [A small fit the pieces together puzzle, very simple in programming but difficult in actually filling the pieces; we will copy one online.]
She proceeds to use the pass-key, which reveals a hidden corridor. Angela decides to go in.

#### Scene 9 [Old Abandoned School]
Angela finds herself at an old abandoned school where she catches the thief from the vault resting. The thief is startled but they engage in conversation, with Angela demanding the codex back. Through convo, the thief reveals that she is part of an underground society dedicated to producing ideas for a living which go directly to the government; she is frustrated by this way of life and so she has taken up trafficking ideas in order to gain enough money to buy her way out into society proper. She explains what is going on with the underground society and its twisted existance: while people live relatively normal lives underground, they do not enjoy the benefits and the luxury of the overground world. However, she is not able to answer how this actually benefits the world above. She also reveals that she got into the Vault to get the codex but then returned to cover her tracks and in the process she saw the report on the underground; figuring out this was about her, she tried to steal it only to be foiled by the player.
* [Angela has a choice: turn the thief in to the police or retrieve the codex for herself. This does not affect the endings - those will be affected by the player's final choice - but does affect the badge the player gains at the end, or perhaps the post-ending, what happened after the player's final choice and corresponding ending.]
Angela decides to confront her father, so she heads back to the Government's Office.

#### Scene 10 [Governor's Office, Government House]
Angela is shown in to the Governor's Office on the last floor where she meets her father. She confronts him about the underground society and he reveals the truth: that this is a system set in parallel to uphold the illusion of internal Creativity. The people in the underground society live in bliss; they are paid well and they live without knowledge of the outside world, happy in their work. At the same time, the overground society  prospers. The central computer behind him upholds the entire system; it processes the ideas from bellow, it distributes it to the pillars of society (like him), it keeps security running and it monitors society for cliches which then it uproots (indirectly, through contacting the police force or publishers).
The player has the following options:
1. They can turn the computer off; basically they throw something in to destroy it, this leads to the rebellion ending, anarchy ensues and a new dawn for humanity.
2. They can agree with their father and join forces; this leads to becoming a pillar, with ideas being rooted towards the player as well; Angela prospers and everything goes unnoticed.
3. The player can turn off their internet; nothing is destroyed, but we make a profound statement about escaping [HURRAY!!].

The player gets one of three endings, along with a badge (one for reporting the thief or one for keeping quiet) and a commendation for restoring all paintings to the library. They could get other badges too, like a badge for finishing the Office Puzzle under X amount of seconds, we will see.

We thank everyone for playing and wish them well.

And then we have chicken wings. At least I will, you can join me or not, it is up to you.

The End

OR NOT? I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet what happens after this. Maybe I will live happily ever after and Elon will lead Twitter to bankruptcy. I mean, it is a Brave New World out ther, we'll see.
