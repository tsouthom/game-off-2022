The Origin
World Building

### Machine Labor
* Work has been completely replaced by machine labor.
* The only work that remains is conjuring original ideas.
* Machine workers (robots) are not humanoids and not considered sentient. There is no large enough sentiment among the populous that robots deserve to be considered "alive".
* Machine workers are physically made to fit their function, not to anthropomorphize. Non-anthropomorphic biomimicry is still utilized if it is optimal to the robot's function.
* They were built by an anthropocentric, utilitarian and strictly anti-transhumanist society which believes in the power of the human "soul".
* The human creative jobs that remain are almost without exception a version of heteromation, i.e. humans are responsible for programming machines in carrying out their creative vision.
* Every cultural artifact is, in practical terms, a machine interpretation of a human idea. Since labor and physicality has been replaced by machines, their mediation necessarily changes the nature of the human "idea" and vision.
There are human-purists who still create using their own embodiment. Their work, however, is rarely recognized as "innovative".

### Social structure
Social structure in this society is given by one's attainment of a position in the highest intellectual echelons. This is achieved by sustained conjuring of "original ideas" and/or creating cultural artifacts characterized by their novelty, originality, rarity, and innovation.
Although the highest echelons of society are designed to be transient and meritocratic, those in the upper class have remained there for a suspiciously long amount of time.
The currency of the world is, ostensibly, social capital. There is no strict measurement system, but rather a reputation and visibility-based social ranking system. This social darwinism hinges on intellect and creativity as people's only purpose is to "progress" culture. The best creatives therefore become the leaders, theoretically for a short amount of time.
The make-up of society brings to light nature vs nurture extremism whereby eugenics and education are seen as two sides of the same coin. In-breeding and intellectual discrimination are neither outlawed nor frowned upon and is one way the ones in power remain so.
People in the "higher echelons" don't necessarily have more money, possessions, or political power, only social capital. They usually gain political power because of their popularity. Having more material goods is generally frowned upon as archaic and brutish. The highest elite love to display their minimal, non-worldly, and cerebral auras.
Everyone else is just a 'citizen' (as opposed to a leader). Note: such words are never capitalized as that's considered cliche. There is overall no poverty, no large social issues, no political strife, no police force. It is a world of abundance, leisure and creativity. People seem to be without wants and are generally happy.

### Interpersonal Relations
There is a large emphasis on having an active, "responsible" and socially acceptable social life. What is socially acceptable is unequivocally "doing you" and "being yourself". Many struggle with being "the most special" and not being boring, as they are stuck in a loop of reinventing themselves and declaring themselves fake for doing so. Teenagers are especially struck by this societal expectation of individuality.
People are so focused on individual creativity and personal self-determination that they seem to have atrophied their empathy and capacity for creating sharing communities. 
Having strong social bonds has a negative correlation with social capital. Not focusing on one's creative output is often seen as lazy and "unbecoming". The lowest-regarded people are those who have traditional families, while others procreate to genetically engineer "brilliant" and "worthy" offspring.

### Aesthetics
While "humanity" is at the core of the society, sexual features are generally seen as distractions from "useful" genetic features.

### Player Character
* Our main character is situated right between these different camps. 
* She is an up-and-coming fiction writer from a first-generation eugenicist family. That means that her parents chose to genetically engineer their children to "succeed" by finding a genetically suitable pair (not by artificially modifying genetic code). She grows up with her father as her mother disappears in her early childhood.
* Our main character is not particularly "attractive" or "un-attractive". She is our "average Jane". Her defining characteristic is her clothing, which is a off-by-one imitation of how the upper echelons dress- like a Steve Jobs Halloween costume that makes her feel like she just pitched the iPhone. She definitely dresses for the job she wants.
* Our character's immediate social structure creates expectations on her "upward social mobility". She is not completely unsuccessful, but she aspires to be one of the most distinguished writers (just like her parents engineered her to be). Every year, the "Foundation for Human Progress" hosts a competition in creativity and problem-solving. It is just the boost that the main character needs to finally step into the limelight.
* The player character is eventually faced with issues of what it really means to have an original "idea", how that is or is not related to human intellect and humanity, how humanity is or is not just coming up with original ideas.

### Non-Player Characters

The player character's younger half-sister
They share the same father. In short, she was engineered as a "fix" to the player character's flaws and is much more successful. The half-sister just broke up with her also elite boyfriend and is having trouble coming to terms with it.

The half-sister was going to have children with her ex-boyfriend but is now heart-broken as she's been replaced by someone "objectively better". She realizes that (for her) her relationship was more than just a "move towards progress" and that she loved her boyfriend. She cannot find someone in her circle who can empathize with that.

The player character struggles to empathize, listen, and create a meaningful bond with her half-sister and instead tries to problem-solve the situation. This is early-on in the story.
The player character's father
The player character's father is clearly someone who is ambitious and opportunistic. He is a collector of original ideas and has been a long-time occupant of the highest echelons of society. He has numerous children, only some of whom have followed him to the highest levels of society (they must earn it for themselves). He is a very strong supporter of the concept of selective breeding of humans (not by force).

This is the character that holds the "McGuffin". The story's plot device is an encrypted "book" which holds a single deconstructed original idea. When inserted into the proper decoding machine, this "book" is then synthesized into what is a fully-formed (yet unrealized) unique and completely novel set of instructions for an artefact to be materialized by a machine worker. These ideas in their unrealized state are the most valuable possessions and they are kept at the Library in private vaults.

The father is an antagonist of the story and he represents cold rationality and chauvinism. The father is later revealed to be the judge in the competition and refuses to help his daughter when she asks him to allow her to use one of his ideas, claiming no obligation towards his offspring after birth. He takes her to the "underground" world and presents it + the option to turn off "the system".

### The thief

The player character's mother chose to settle down after she abandoned the life of trying to "make it" to the top. While the player character was following in her father's footsteps, she lost touch with her mother's side of the family.

However, this is at the same time as her time-slot in the competition, so the player must choose which one to do.

### Plot 
The player takes part in the competition and fails.
ONE YEAR LATER
The player character has her annual rendezvous with her sister at the Grand Reveal at the Gallery. The competition is the next day. 
They go to a bar and speak. 
The player character finds out about a codex having been stolen from their father's collection at the Library.
The player character hunts down the codex using their problem-solving skills.
Locations: Library > Old School turned to Therapy Group.
It is revealed that the thief is a person who knew the player character's mother. They invite the player character to meet them and find out what why she had disappeared. The thief is set to leave town soon as stealing a codex is one of the few serious crimes.
The story takes a pseudo-branching path: the player takes the codex and either: submits it to the competition as their own idea OR destroys it and follows the thief to find out about her mother.
If the player chooses to go to the competition, the father takes her down to where thousands of people are typing random stuff in computers, creating the "original ideas" for the upper class.  The tour, given by the father, is presented with disgust. The player is forced to hand over the codex and then return to her previous status, the father saying he wouldn't wish this fate to his own daughter. The player has the chance to destroy this entire system, exposing the father and "freeing" the citizens living in this secret community.
If the player chooses to go with the thief, the same reveal is done but now done in a positive light. This place, where ideas are collectively generated, is filled with happy people. They are allowed to be in families, they have a "humanity" that no one on the "surface" has. It is explained that the player's mother founded this community in exchange for her freedom and soon many others joined her. The price was that this community helped keep the player's father considered a "genius" as they created ideas for him. The player is given the chance to destroy the entire system, exposing the father and "freeing" the citizens living in this secret community.
